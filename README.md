Insights
The data is given from Timestamp('2011-01-01 00:00:00') to Timestamp('2012-12-19 23:00:00'). The
total time period for which the data is given is '718 days 23:00:00'.
Out of every 100 users, around 19 are casual users and 81 are registered users.
The mean total hourly count of rental bikes is 144 for the year 2011 and 239 for the year 2012. An
annual growth rate of 65.41 % can be seen in the demand of electric vehicles on an hourly basis.
There is a seasonal pattern in the count of rental bikes, with higher demand during the spring and
summer months, a slight decline in the fall, and a further decrease in the winter months.
The average hourly count of rental bikes is the lowest in the month of January followed by February and
March.
There is a distinct fluctuation in count throughout the day, with low counts during early morning hours, a
sudden increase in the morning, a peak count in the afternoon, and a gradual decline in the evening and
nighttime.
More than 80 % of the time, the temperature is less than 28 degrees celcius.
More than 80 % of the time, the humidity value is greater than 40. Thus for most of the time, humidity
level varies from optimum to too moist.
More than 85 % of the total, windspeed data has a value of less than 20.
The hourly count of total rental bikes is the highest in the clear and cloudy weather, followed by the misty
weather and rainy weather. There are very few records for extreme weather conditions.
The mean hourly count of the total rental bikes is statistically similar for both working and non- working
days.
There is statistically significant dependency of weather and season based on the hourly total number of
bikes rented.

Recommendations
Seasonal Marketing: Since there is a clear seasonal pattern in the count of rental bikes, Yulu can adjust
its marketing strategies accordingly. Focus on promoting bike rentals during the spring and summer
months when there is higher demand. Offer seasonal discounts or special packages to attract more
customers during these periods.
Time-based Pricing: Take advantage of the hourly fluctuation in bike rental counts throughout the day.
Consider implementing time-based pricing where rental rates are lower during off-peak hours and higher
during peak hours. This can encourage customers to rent bikes during less busy times, balancing out
the demand and optimizing the resources.
Weather-based Promotions: Recognize the impact of weather on bike rentals. Create weather-based
promotions that target customers during clear and cloudy weather, as these conditions show the highest
rental counts. Yulu can offer weather-specific discounts to attract more customers during these favorable
weather conditions.
User Segmentation: Given that around 81% of users are registered, and the remaining 19% are casual,
Yulu can tailor its marketing and communication strategies accordingly. Provide loyalty programs,
exclusive offers, or personalized recommendations for registered users to encourage repeat business.

For casual users, focus on providing a seamless rental experience and promoting the benefits of bike
rentals for occasional use.
Optimize Inventory: Analyze the demand patterns during different months and adjust the inventory
accordingly. During months with lower rental counts such as January, February, and March, Yulu can
optimize its inventory levels to avoid excess bikes. On the other hand, during peak months, ensure
having sufficient bikes available to meet the higher demand.
Improve Weather Data Collection: Given the lack of records for extreme weather conditions, consider
improving the data collection process for such scenarios. Having more data on extreme weather
conditions can help to understand customer behavior and adjust the operations accordingly, such as
offering specialized bike models for different weather conditions or implementing safety measures during
extreme weather.
Customer Comfort: Since humidity levels are generally high and temperature is often below 28 degrees
Celsius, consider providing amenities like umbrellas, rain jackets, or water bottles to enhance the
comfort and convenience of the customers. These small touches can contribute to a positive customer
experience and encourage repeat business.
Collaborations with Weather Services: Consider collaborating with weather services to provide realtime weather updates and forecasts to potential customers. Incorporate weather information into your
marketing campaigns or rental app to showcase the ideal biking conditions and attract users who prefer
certain weather conditions.
Seasonal Bike Maintenance: Allocate resources for seasonal bike maintenance. Before the peak
seasons, conduct thorough maintenance checks on the bike fleet to ensure they are in top condition.
Regularly inspect and service bikes throughout the year to prevent breakdowns and maximize customer
satisfaction.
Customer Feedback and Reviews: Encourage customers to provide feedback and reviews on their
biking experience. Collecting feedback can help identify areas for improvement, understand customer
preferences, and tailor the services to better meet customer expectations.
Social Media Marketing: Leverage social media platforms to promote the electric bike rental services.
Share captivating visuals of biking experiences in different weather conditions, highlight customer
testimonials, and engage with potential customers through interactive posts and contests. Utilize
targeted advertising campaigns to reach specific customer segments and drive more bookings.
Special Occasion Discounts: Since Yulu focusses on providing a sustainable solution for vehicular
pollution, it should give special discounts on the occassions like Zero Emissions Day (21st September)
